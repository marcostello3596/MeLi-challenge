# MeLi Challenge

I did the challenge with Next JS and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

# Technical Observations

In the design of the search results you can see the place of origin of the product (Capital Federal, Mendoza, etc). However, the API document does not include the "city" field.
